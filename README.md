# RapidMaternal

RapidMaternal is a real-time maternal emergency response system designed to reduce delays in obstetric referrals at the subdistrict and district levels.

The system enables frontline health workers to trigger, track, and escalate maternal emergencies in real time, improving coordination, response times, and accountability across facilities.

RapidMaternal is built with open-source technologies and optimized for low-resource settings, with a focus on district ownership, auditability, and safe deployment.

## Problem Statement

Maternal emergencies often suffer from delayed recognition, poor communication, and weak referral coordination—especially in subdistrict and rural settings.

Current systems rely heavily on phone calls and informal messaging, which:
- Are difficult to track
- Lack accountability
- Do not provide real-time visibility to district leadership

These delays contribute significantly to preventable maternal morbidity and mortality.

## Project Objectives

- Enable real-time reporting of maternal emergencies
- Improve coordination between CHPS zones, health centres, and district teams
- Provide clear escalation and acknowledgement workflows
- Create an auditable trail of emergency response actions
- Support data-driven quality improvement at district level

---

## Scope (Phase 1)

In Phase 1, RapidMaternal will:
- Allow authorized health workers to trigger maternal emergency alerts
- Notify relevant responders in real time
- Track acknowledgements and response timelines
- Provide a basic dashboard for oversight

The system will **not**:
- Replace clinical decision-making
- Provide automated diagnosis or treatment
- Override existing referral protocols

## Target Users

- Midwives and CHPS staff
- Health centre in-charges
- District Health Management Teams (DHMT)
